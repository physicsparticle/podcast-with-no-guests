# podcast-with-no-guests

ill tell u the whole story of igem next, i think that's interesting and ~funny~ serious-ish but with some funny stories from undergrad times?? it'll prolly be an hr long or something, and ill record it next month bc i wanna write down notes of everything and tell a good story but some of it is my IP, bc that was my team ... start, middle and end, so i dont want to share everything 

ill tell u the story of how i ... we ... basically just wanted to show up george church that year of igem lol ... hence "complex circuits in synthetic biology" more complex than george church's team that year ðŸ˜‚ and we're going to do it all by ourselves and so we did ... ill also talk about scott belsky's book that i used, i still have my copy from 2011, https://www.amazon.com/Making-Ideas-Happen-Overcoming-Obstacles/dp/1591844118 ill talk about what he talks about and what i liked and what i implemented

im not going to record too many of these, maybe once a month bc i have (always) the right to havea private conversation with you and its bullshit that that cant happen and i dont want to give away information regarding nomial/future directions bc i will never talk about that openly in any way shape or form
